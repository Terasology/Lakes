Lakes
=======================


Current features:  
-polygon lakes based on distorted ellipsoids  
-underground and surface lakes and lava lakes  
-lava lakes can be turned on and off  
-lakes will create a small cave above them  
-desert lakes are less probable and will turn into palm tree oases

Known issues:  
-Missing biome modification to prevent grass and trees to spawn on lakes  
~~-surface lakes have difficulties appearing in perlin and other non flat world gens (unknown reason)~~  
-the "tubs" of surface lakes are sometimes incomplete  

Future plans:  
-join adjacent surface lakes together to one waterheight  
-add lake biome  
-base lake probability  on surfacehumidityfacet  
-add additional probability for lakes to spawn in caves  
~~-add an air layer for underground lakes above the watersurface~~  
-add more configurations for lava and water lakes  
-the "tubs" are sometimes a bit ugly
